# Region-Based Detection Implementation

This project implements a region-based detection system using Selective Search for region proposals combined with Haar Cascade for face detection. The implementation consists of two main scripts that demonstrate different aspects of the region-based detection approach.

## 1. Region-Based Detector (region_based_detector.py)

### Overview
This script implements a complete region-based detection pipeline that combines region proposals with face detection. It uses Selective Search for generating region proposals and Haar Cascade for face detection within these regions.

### Key Components

#### Region Proposal Generation
- Uses OpenCV's Selective Search implementation in quality mode
- Filters proposals based on minimum size requirements
- Limits the maximum number of proposals to manage computational cost
- Implements non-maximum suppression to reduce overlapping detections

#### Face Detection Pipeline
- Loads pre-trained Haar Cascade face detector
- Processes each region proposal for face detection
- Applies face detection on grayscale versions of the regions
- Converts region-relative coordinates to absolute image coordinates

## 2. Region Proposals Visualizer (region_proposals_visualizer.py)

This script is used to visualize the region proposals generated by Selective Search. It creates a visualization of the region proposals (not all of them) with random colors and draws final detection results with bounding boxes.

## Implementation Details

### Processing Pipeline
1. Image Loading
2. Region Proposal Generation
3. Proposal Filtering
4. Face Detection
5. Non-Maximum Suppression
6. Visualization
7. Results saved to region_proposals_results/ and region_detection_results/

### Output Organization
- Creates dedicated output directories
- Saves individual results
- Supports multiple image formats (jpg, png, pgm)
- Maintains original image names with appropriate prefixes

## Limitations

As could be seen in the output, the face detection accuracy is pretty high except that some faces that are occluded or partly occluded are not detected and some regions are wrongly detected as faces. This is due to the limitations of the Haar Cascade classifier itself, where it only analyzes the grayscale of the image and it's very likely that a non-face could be identified as a face, c.f.
