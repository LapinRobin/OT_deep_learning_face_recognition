First, install the requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, run the training script:

```
python train.py
```

With the model trained, you can run the test script:

```
python test.py
```

This script will evaluate the model on the test dataset and print the accuracy (and a beautiful confusion matrix).

For the moment, I set the number of epochs to 3, but you can change it in the train.py file.
